# Privacy Policy for Selectable

**Last Updated:** November 20, 2025

## 1. Data Collection

The **Selectable** browser extension (**"the Add-on"**) is designed with privacy as its core principle.

- **No Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal information, browsing history, or usage data.
- **No Analytics:** The Add-on does not use any third-party analytics software (e.g., Google Analytics) to track user behavior.
- **No Remote Servers:** The Add-on operates entirely locally on your device. It does not communicate with any external servers or APIs.

## 2. Permissions Usage

The Add-on requires specific browser permissions to function. Here is how they are used:

- **`activeTab`**: This is used only when you click the extension icon. It allows the Add-on to identify the current tab and inject the selection interface.
- **`scripting`**: This is used to programmatically inject the CSS (visuals) and JavaScript (logic) required to draw the selection overlay on the page.
- **`clipboardWrite`**: This is used strictly to copy the data you have explicitly selected to your system clipboard.

## 3. Data Storage

The Add-on does not store any data permanently. Temporary data (such as the list of currently selected table cells) is held in your computer's RAM only while the extension is active and is cleared immediately upon deactivation or closing the tab.
